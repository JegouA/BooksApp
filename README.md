# BooksApp

In progress

## Description

BooksApp is a small project to create a database of epub books.
It is implemented to take into account multiple users and create a big database of books.
The idea is to select books to read according to the theme or the author.

## What does it do?

- Parse the folders containing all the epubs of an user, extract the metadata and copy the cover. The books
are save in books table, and a library table is made for each user.
- User will be able to give a rating and say if the book has been read or not
- User will be able to ask what books is in its PAL, and what to read depending on the themes

## Futur development

- Create a Graphical Interface
